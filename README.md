# Pong made in Love2d
A casual game of Pong against a custom bot.

# Auto Mode
Auto Mode lets AI control your paddle.
Press "space" to toggle its function.

# Don't bully the AI 😣😣
The **blue paddle's bot is kind of stupid and may always miss the ball.** Please be nice to him... I swear he'll learn from his misses. 😓😓

# July Update! 07/27/2025
Featuring!! 🥁🥁:
* **Ball spawns going on any direction!** No longer limited to bursting at only 4 directions!
* **Changed the ball to be irritating.** Be wary of it!
* Changed **AI's minds to catch the ball with the tips of their paddles!**
* **Accumalating rate of speed!**
* **Red Paddle AI's ego lowered down.** They can't handle the new features 
* Changed **auto mode's toggle command**

# The Past Is Still Present!
Though this update is different than the other versions, **some of the code are left untouched to present my past inexperience** 😁😀😀😁
###### (Nothing's really changed about my skills in recent projects) 😥
